QR voice
========

QR voice is a web application that generates qr-codes for synthesized voice messages.

### How does it work?

1. Go to [qrvoice.net](http://qrvoice.net)
2. Type any message into the main input box
3. Optionally pick a language in which the message should be pronounced (this is not for translation)
4. Click *generate* button right next to input box (there's a small qr-code icon in it)
5. Share the message either by downloading/printing it or using the link above the qr-code image
6. Spread the word using the social buttons 
7. Obviously a mobile device and a qr-code scanner app is needed to decode and play the message

*User interface is available in different languages through far bottom dropdown list*

* No idea what the heck is qr-code? [Check it out](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code)
* QR voice is powered by [YUI](http://yuilibrary.com/) for interface,
  [Google APIs](http://code.google.com/apis/) for synthesized voice playback and qr-code image
  and [bit.ly](http://api.bit.ly/) for URL shorten using custom domain.
